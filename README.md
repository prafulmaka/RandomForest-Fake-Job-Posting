# RandomForest-Fake-Job-Postings
The notebook walks through the Random Forest model to predict fake job postings. In this notebook, we use only the RF model as it yielded the best results compared to logistic regression (baseline) and deep neural networks. The RF model was able to predict fraudulent job postings with an accuracy of 98%.
